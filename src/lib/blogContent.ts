            <p>Afrobeats has transcended its roots to become a dominant force in global music. But what happens next? As we look to 2025, the genre is shedding its "radio-friendly" constraints and embracing experimental fusion.</p>
            <p>Artists are no longer just musicians; they are brands, movements, and cultural architects. This shift requires a new kind of management—one that understands the digital ecosystem as well as the studio.</p>
            <h2>The Digital Renaissance</h2>

            <p>In a world where 100,000 songs are uploaded to Spotify every day, talent is the baseline, not the differentiator. Your brand is your story, your aesthetic, and your promise to the audience.</p>
            <p>At VIBESTOSTARDOM, we believe in "Identity First." Before a single note is released, we define who you are. This ensures that when the music hits, it connects on a deeper level.</p>

            <p>From missing gear in Abuja to unexpected sold-out crowds in Accra, the energy was palpable. This is why we do what we do.</p>
